\section{Introduction}

\plant[e]{Cs}\index{Cannabis sativa L.} is a plant of significant economic and medicinal interest, cultivated for its various applications including fiber, seed oil, and pharmacologically active compounds such as cannabinoids and terpenes. The growth and development of cannabis plants can be influenced by numerous environmental factors, among which light quality and intensity play pivotal roles. Light not only serves as the primary energy source for photosynthesis but also acts as a signal regulating various physiological processes \autocite{eichhorn_bilodeau_update_2019}.
