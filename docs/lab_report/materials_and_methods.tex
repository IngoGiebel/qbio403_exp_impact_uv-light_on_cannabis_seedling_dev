\subsection{Experimental procedure}

On May 2, ten DUTCH PASSION Passion \#1 feminized seeds and two DUTCH PASSION Skywalker Haze feminized seeds were planted in \qty[mode=text]{3}{\L} fabric planting containers filled with lightly fertilized organic coconut potting soil with added mycorrhizae. The seeds were germinated and initially grown under full-spectrum LED lights (PHLIZON FD6000 PLUS 640W). The plants were divided into two groups, with one group receiving additional light from four LuxElite PlantUV grow lights.

On May 13, these plants were transplanted into \qty[mode=text]{15}{\L} fabric planting containers with fertilized organic coconut potting soil. Additionally, ten DUTCH PASSION Frisian Dew regular seeds were planted in \qty[mode=text]{3}{\L} fabric planting containers under the same conditions. Again, the plants were divided into two groups, with half of the plants receiving supplementary UV light.

On June 16, after \num[mode=text]{45} days of growth for the first set of plants and \num[mode=text]{34} days for the second set, the plants were assessed for the following growth parameters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Plant height\index{growth parameter!plant height}: Measured from the base of the stem to the highest point using a ruler.
    \item Stem diameter\index{growth parameter!stem diameter}: Measured \qty[mode=text]{2}{\cm} above the soil line using a caliper.
    \item Number of internodes\index{growth parameter!number of internodes}: Counted from the base to the top of the plant.
\end{itemize}

Additionally, light conditions were measured using a THORLABS CCS200/M light spectrometer\index{light spectrometer!THORLABS CCS200/M}.

\subsection{Growing conditions}

The temperature\index{growing condition!temperature} was maintained at about \qty[mode=text]{21}{\degreeCelsius}. The height of the grow lights\index{grow light} was adjusted to maintain a distance of approximately \qty[mode=text]{20}{\cm} from the tip of the tallest plant. The LED grow lights\index{grow light!LED} were set to \qty[mode=text]{100}{\percent} dimmable intensity. All lights were on daily from 5:35 a.m. to 9:35 p.m. (\qty[mode=text]{16}{hr} daily). On June 16, the local sunrise was at 5:18 a.m. and the sunset was at 9:52 p.m.
