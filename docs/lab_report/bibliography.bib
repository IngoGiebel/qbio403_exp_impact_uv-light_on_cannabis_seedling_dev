	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}This review presents recent developments in plant photobiology and lighting systems for horticultural crops, as well as potential applications for cannabis ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}Cannabis sativa{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} and {\textless}italic{\textgreater}C. indica{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}) plant production. The legal and commercial production of the cannabis plant is a relatively new, rapidly growing, and highly profitable industry in Europe and North America. However, more knowledge transfer from plant studies and horticultural communities to commercial cannabis plant growers is needed. Plant photosynthesis and photomorphogenesis are influenced by light wavelength, intensity, and photoperiod {\textless}italic{\textgreater}via{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} plant photoreceptors that sense light and control plant growth. Further, light properties play a critical role in plant vegetative growth and reproductive (flowering) developmental stages, as well as in biomass, secondary metabolite synthesis, and accumulation. Advantages and disadvantages of widespread greenhouse lighting systems that use high pressure sodium lamps or light emitting diode ({LED}) lighting are known. Some artificial plant lighting practices will require improvements for cannabis production. By manipulating {LED} light spectra and stimulating specific plant photoreceptors, it may be possible to minimize operation costs while maximizing cannabis biomass and cannabinoid yield, including tetrahydrocannabinol (or Δ$^{\textrm{9}}$-tetrahydrocannabinol) and cannabidiol for medicinal and recreational purposes. The basics of plant photobiology (photosynthesis and photomorphogenesis) and electrical lighting systems are discussed, with an emphasis on how the light spectrum and lighting strategies could influence cannabis production and secondary compound accumulation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Given the special pharmacological value of cannabidiol ({CBD}), industrial hemp (hemp) has become a real “hot” crop. Though indoor farming of hemp has been widely used, the effects of red and blue light-emitting diode ({LED}) acting as supplementary light on the {CBD} synthesis in hemp remains unclear. Herein, a pot experiment with six treatments [{CK}, high-pressure sodium as light source, (R:B (ratio of red light to blue light) 9.30:1, {PPFD} (photosynthetic photon flux density) 191); {LED}1 (R:B 9.20:1; {PPFD} 129); {LED}2 (R:B 1.61:1; {PPFD} 540); {LED}3 (R:B 6.47:1; {PPFD} 28.2); {LED}4 (R:B 7.15:1; {PPFD} 41.7); {LED}5 (R:B 16.8:1; {PPFD} 252)] was carried out to study the effects of {LED} light quality on the growth and cannabinoid synthesis of hemp. Results showed that {LED}2 and {LED}5 could well maintain hemp growth compared with {CK} in terms of plant height, stem diameter, and leaf numbers. Compared with {CK}, the treatment of {LED}1, {LED}4, and {LED}3 significantly decreased the aboveground biomass, while {LED}2 and {LED}5 notably improved the aboveground biomass with an increment of 15.2 \% and 55.1 \%; the biomass of hemp flowers for {LED}2 and {LED}5 was markedly increased compared with that for {CK} with increments of 238 \% and 61.5 \%, respectively, but the other {LED} light treatments significantly reduced the flowers yield; {LED}2 could significantly increase the {CBD} content of both leaves (1.81 \%) and flowers (5.83 \%) compared to {CK} (leaves 1.38 \%, flowers 4.27 \%) while {LED}5 only notably increased the {CBD} content of leaves; among the {LED} treatments, the theoretic {CBD} yield for a per plant of {LED}2 and {LED}5 was 26.8 \% and 9.0 \% higher than that of {CK}. In conclusion, different red and blue {LED} light intensity ratios would dramatically influence the growth and cannabinoid synthesis of hemp, {LED}2 and {LED}5 can be good choices for indoor farming of hemp targeted for higher {CBD} yield.},

	abstract = {The effect of low artificial Ultraviolet ({UV}) on the {DNA} methylation remains controversial. This study addresses how differential photoperiods of {UV} radiation affect the biochemical and molecular behaviors of Cannabis indica cell suspension cultures. The cell suspensions were illuminated with the compact fluorescent lamps ({CFL}), emitting a combination of 10\% {UVB}, 30\% {UVA}, and the rest visible wavelengths for 0, 4, 8, and 16 h. The applied photoperiods influenced cell morphological characteristics. The 4 h photoperiod was the most effective treatment for improving biomass, growth index and cell viability percentage while these indices remained non-significant in the 16 h treatment. The methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism ({MASP}) assay revealed that the {UV} radiation was epigenetically accompanied by {DNA} hypermethylation. The light-treated cells significantly displayed higher relative expression of the cannabidiolic‌ acid synthase ({CBDAS}) and delta9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid synthase ({THCAS}) genes about 4-fold. The expression of the olivetolic acid cyclase ({OAC}) and olivetol synthase ({OLS}) genes exhibited an upward trend in response to the {UV} radiation. The light treatments also enhanced the proline content and protein concentration. The 4 h illumination was significantly capable of improving the cannabidiol ({CBD}) and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol ({THC}) concentrations, in contrast with 16 h. By increasing the illumination exposure time, the activity of the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase ({PAL}) enzyme linearly upregulated. The highest amounts of the phenylpropanoid derivatives were observed in the cells cultured under the radiation for 4 h. Taken collective, artificial {UV} radiation can induce {DNA} methylation modifications and impact biochemical and molecular differentiation in the cell suspensions in a photoperiod-dependent manner.},
